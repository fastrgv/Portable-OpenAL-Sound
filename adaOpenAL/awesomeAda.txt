Portable Ada Sound using OpenAL

This is a cross-platform sound-playing package for Ada apps that can asynchronously start and stop music loops, as well as initiate transient sounds.

It plays WAV files, via OpenAL, on Windows, OSX, and linux platforms.

It is suitable for any Ada application that needs music, sound loops or transient sound effects; eg. games.
