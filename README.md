# Portable Sound -- using Ada tasking and OpenAL



**ver 1.1.0 -- 19oct2021**
* Now builds on GPL-GNAT as well as all versions of AdaCore.

**ver 1.0.1 -- 17feb2021**

* Added important guard statement for robustness.

* Update 6nov: added DLL to example directory.

* Update 12nov: added W64,OSX build scripts + EXEs to C++ example.


## Description

This is a partial Ada binding to OpenAL, together with a client Ada package that can 
play WAV files on Windows, OSX, and Linux, using Ada tasking and OpenAL libraries.

It provides sound-playing capabilities for Ada apps to 
	* asynchronously start and stop music/sound loops, 
	* initiate transient sounds,
	* allow unlimited sound concurrency.

Examples for each O.S. are included.

It is suitable for any Ada application that requires background or transient 
sound effects; eg. games, simulations.

There are no software dependencies; this package is self-contained.

--------------------------------------------------------
## Usage:

The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

See the simple interface description in file snd4ada.ads.

Generally, when you initialize a sound or soundloop, you specify its file name and retrieve an integer "key" that is used to play it sometime later.

Note: an error occurs whenever there is something fishy about the WAV file. I always get good results with WAV files output from, or processed through "sox".

========================================================
## What is so great about this package?

This package is a non-platform-specific Ada code that compiles on Windows as well as OSX and Linux. It is now used in my two flagship games: AdaGate and AdaVenture (on GitHub & SourceForge). 


========================================================

## Ada Examples:

See ./adaExample/one.adb
See ./adaExample/two.adb

The examples come with 3 compilation scripts: lcmp.sh, ocmp.sh, wcmp.bat

## C++ Examples

See ./cppExample/two.cpp

This comes with scripts for linux and Windows. It shows how to use
the Ada package from a C++ main. If any Mac experts out there
can show me how to build on OSX, I would like to include it.
