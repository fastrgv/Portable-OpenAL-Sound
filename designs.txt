My Design Goals (for Potential Contributors):

I dislike both Microsoft and Apple because of the freedoms and privacy they deny me, and I fully support the F.S.F [Free Software Foundation].  Thusly, I choose to minimize my entanglement with these OS's.  Still, I would like to reach their large audiences with my programs.

My design goals are to 
A) require NOTHING of mere users, and 
B) for rebuilders/developers, require only that they install Ada on their machines.

Specifically, I do not require Windows users to install MINGW.

Furthermore, I don't require users to install nonstandard libraries or 3rd party utilities in order to execute my apps.
